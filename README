I3D Assignment 02 - Island Defence 3D

Worked as a pair:
s3717437 - Frank Marazita - 50% contribution
s3719157 - Thomas Bobbera - 50% contribution

Running instructions:
- Visual Studio project made for Windows, open solution in vs/ folder
- Made using VS project template we were given in one of the labs for working on Windows
- Run the VS program and build
- Exe won't display textures correctly if the program is not run through VS, unless placed (with freeglut.dll) inside vs/ folder due to the working directory on VS
- Program will run fine if run through VS however

Controls are the same as requested.

Features implemented:
- PA: baseline:
	- Boats on flat 3D water and 3D island with scene lighting and interactive viewer/camera controls.
	- Wireframe/filled rendering controls
	- Normal/tangent visualisation
	- Tesselation controls
- CR: PA baseline plus:
	- Boats spawning with simple AI directing them towards the island, firing cannonballs with projectile motion.
	- Island cannon able to fire a cannon under interactive user control.
	- Projectile trajectory rendering
	- Cannonball collision detection
	- Boat and island health
- DI: CR plus
	- Static 3D sine wave water

- HD: DI plus
	- Animated sine wave water.
	- Polished gameplay, multiple missiles, cooldown, advanced rendering, OSD, missle defence, complex water.
	- Correct 3D cannonball firing from boat, taking in to account boat rotation.
	- Use of arrays to store vertex data.
	- Advanced Features implemented:
		- Particle effects
